A safe space for people trying to create a better life.

## about the project
This project was started in 2019 at a hackathon in Wellesley, Massachusetts. I came up with it while watching an acapella performance as a break from the hack, and then *it came to me*.

>>>Imagine a quiet campus on the east coast. Students mill about in the depths of the night from the library to the dining hall, looking for a quick snack. A student has not been feeling very well recently. She is homesick and in need of comfort. She walks up to a long tube, akin to the medicine transportation devices at a pharmacy drive through, and dons the pairs of virtual reality glasses and headphones hanging on the side of the device. With a touch of her phone to the device, she could see the virtual reality safe space she had spent time carefully curating come to life.
